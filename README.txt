After you have set up PostgreSQL, 
Create a Database called "pythonTest" or the name you specified for the {database} variable
(Student Table auto created by the program)

Make sure that the latest version of python is installed
python --version
(Python 3.10.7) was used


Library installations:

> pip install psycopg

For me, I ran into some importing issues in the code - so input this command
And it fixed the library/code importing issues for me

> pip install psycopg[binary]

-----
To execute:
C:File/Location> & C:\Python310\python.exe .\Assign3-Q1-AlexV.py
-----

I used visual studio and installed the python and other recommended tools, this is also generally how I run the program.
